# Expired credentials errors

You have got one of the following messages:

- "Invalid or expired token"
- "Your credentials do not allow access to this resource"

In practice it does mean that you need to repeat the Twitter authentication process in your iOS device. In order to do so follow this step by step guide:

1.- Go to Settings app and then to the Twitter section.

2.- First of all check that Still Follows app is authorized in section "ALLOW THESE APPS TO USE YOUR ACCOUNT".

5.- Close Still Follows app and the open again and try to log in. Now it should be working. In case it is still not working, please go to step 5.

6.- OPTIONAL: If step 5 fails, then the only solution will be to remove the Twitter account from the device and then add it again. The way to do it is just to repeat steps from 1 to 4 but tapping the "Delete account" button in step 4. Once deleted, you can sign in again with the "Add account" or the "Sign in" button.
