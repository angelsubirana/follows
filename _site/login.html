<h1>Log In troubles?</h1>

<p>The most common Twitter log in error messages are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Invalid or expired token”</li>
  <li>“Your credentials do not allow access to this resource”</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice it does mean that you need to repeat the Twitter authentication process in your iOS device. In order to do so follow this step by step guide:</p>

<p>1.- Go to Settings app and then to the Twitter section. First of all check that Still Friends app is authorized in section “ALLOW THESE APPS TO USE YOUR ACCOUNT”.</p>

<p>4.- Close Still Follows app and the open again and try to log in. Now it should be working. In case it is still not working, please go to step 5.</p>

<p>5.- OPTIONAL: If step 4 fails, then the only solution will be to remove the Twitter account from the device and then add it again. The way to do it is just to repeat steps from 1 to 4 but tapping the “Delete account” button in step 4. Once deleted, you can sign in again with the “Add account” or the “Sign in” button.</p>
