# Log In troubles?

The most common reason why the log in process does not work is because the account in your iOS device has no valid tokens to authenticate. In practice it does mean that you need to repeat the authentication process in your device. In order to do so follow this step by step guide:

1.- Go to Settings app and then to the Twitter section. First of all check that Still Friends app is authorized in section "ALLOW THESE APPS TO USE YOUR ACCOUNT".

2.- Now tap on your Twitter account to access the account parameters.

3.- Delete the contents of the password field and then re-enter the password again. Finally tap "Done".

4.- Close Still Follows app and the open again and try to log in. Now it should be working. In case it is still not working, please go to step 5.

5.- OPTIONAL: If step 4 fails, then the only solution will be to remove the Twitter account from the device and then add it again. The way to do it is just to repeat steps from 1 to 4 but tapping the "Delete account" button in step 4. Once deleted, you can sign in again with the "Add account" or the "Sign in" button.
